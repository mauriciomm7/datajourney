### 1 Project Description 
This Jupyter Notebook contains my final class project for the Summer course *MS03: Python Programming for Social Scientists* by the ECPR in association with KU Leuven. The main objective of this project is to consolidate my newfound skillset of data, collection, processing and manipulation from different sources such as websites or APIs.

Thus, for this project I will be working with scrapped web data from the Cambridge Core series journals on Political Science. The aim of this project is to describe patterns found across the *most cited* journals.


In this work **Most Cited** referes to self defined category of journals as listed on the Cambridge Core website. According to [Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/most-cited?pageNum=278&searchWithinIds=833A7242AC7B607BA7F6168DA072DB3B%2CDEF6D9E6432F4E804AD2D9416C8C2165&productType=JOURNAL_ARTICLE&pageSize=20&filters%5BisCitedByMin%5D=0&template=cambridge-core%2Fjournal%2Farticle-listings%2Flistings-wrapper&displayNasaAds=false&showCitationNumbers=true&suppressArticleTypeGrouping=true&sort=platformMetadata.citationCount.crossRef%3Adesc). This page lists the all time most cited articles for any given journal. 

### Objectives
**Create a database of the the most cited journals from a Cambridge Core Journal.**

Target attributes: 
- Title 
- Authors 
- Publication Data 
- Citations

**Create adidtional attributes from scrapped data**

Additional attributes: 
- Number of authors
- Gender of author(s)
- Publication year

**Create Preliminary Data Analysis and Visualization** 
- Descriptive Statistics
- Data Visualizations

**NOTE:** To render plots and charts please open directly in Google Collab.
